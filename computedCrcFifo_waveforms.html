<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "computedCrcFifo.vhd" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of scfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "computedCrcFifo.vhd".  The design "computedCrcFifo.vhd" has a depth of 32 words of 32 bits each. The fifo is in legacy synchronous mode.  The data becomes available after 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read request. </P>
