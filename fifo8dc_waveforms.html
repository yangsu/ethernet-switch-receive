<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "fifo8dc.vhd" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of dcfifo_mixed_widths megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "fifo8dc.vhd".  The design "fifo8dc.vhd" has a write-side depth of 256 words of 4 bits each. a read-side width of 8. The fifo is in legacy synchronous mode.  The data becomes available after 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read request. </P>
